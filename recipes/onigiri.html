        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Also known as <em>o-musubi</em> or <em>nigirimeshi</em>, onigiri are Japanese rice ball snacks made from
           cooked or steamed sushi rice, furikake seasonings (and sometimes tasty hidden fillings), wrapped a nori seaweed wrapper.</p>

        <p>In Japan, they’re either made at home in the morning or purchased from a nearby kombini (convenience store), then taken 
            to work or school as a tasty snack or quick lunch.</p>

        <p>Onigiri are similar yet different to sushi rolls or handrolled temaki sushi. The biggest difference is that regular sushi 
            is seasoned with sushi vinegar while ongiri starts from a base of plain rice. We also think they are <em>so much easier</em> to 
            make than regular sushi!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Furikake</li>
            <li>Nori</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. 
                Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to 
                your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</li>
            <li>Take up one portion of rice in your hands.</li>
            <li>If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside 
                and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</li>
            <li>Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice 
                into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so it’s even.</li>
            <li>Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice) and fold it up 
                towards to the middle of the onigiri.</li>
        </ol>
