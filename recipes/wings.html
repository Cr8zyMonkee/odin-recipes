        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>These delicious Buffalo Chicken Wings are similar to a recipe from a popular restaurant chain that specializes in chicken wings.</p>
            <p>If you have had these wings before, you have to love them.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>10 chicken wings</li>
                <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
                <li>¼ cup butter</li>
                <li>¼ cup hot sauce</li>
                <li>1 dash ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 dash garlic powder</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl mix together the flour, paprika, cayenne pepper and salt. Place chicken wings in a large nonporous glass 
                    dish or bowl and sprinkle flour mixture over them until they are evenly coated. Cover dish or bowl and refrigerate for 
                    60 to 90 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). The oil should be just enough to cover wings entirely, an 
                    inch or so deep. Combine the butter, hot sauce, pepper and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir together 
                    and heat until butter is melted and mixture is well blended. Remove from heat and reserve for serving.</li>
                <li>Fry coated wings in hot oil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until parts of wings begin to turn brown. Remove from heat, place 
                    wings in serving bowl, add hot sauce mixture and stir together. Serve.</li>
            </ol>
